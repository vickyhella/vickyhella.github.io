## Overview

This post records some useful words/phrases that we can use when collaborating on GitHub.

### Nit

**Meaning**:

Nit in a code review stands for nitpicking: a finding that is not very important or meaningful for the functionality of the code, but still wrong.

Sometimes the reviewer will prefix his comments with "Nit:". This means that he's just "nitpicking"--you don't have to fix these points, but we'd like you to.

**Usage**:

- Nit: Trailing whitespace
- Issue 9662: fix minor style nit (Closed)
- One nit, but the rest LGTM

### ditto

**Meaning**:

As before or aforesaid: in the same manner â€”used to indicate that a previous statement also applies to something or someone else.

**Usage**:

If you found a mistake in a PR and already gave your comment on it, you can say "ditto" when you see it for the second and later occurrences.
