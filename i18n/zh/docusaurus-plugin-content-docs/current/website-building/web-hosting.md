## Introduction
To my understanding, Web Hosting is about where to put your static webstie files.

When considering which web hosting service to use, I expect the service to:
- Be easy to maintain
- Be free-of-charge
- Support custom domains

Then I narrowed it down to two services: GitHub Pages and Netlify.
