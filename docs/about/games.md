# Games I've Played

The following are games that I've played recently. I think it's interesting to put them here to remind me all the fun they've given to me.

I will try to comment on all the games listed here (ToDo). I believe this might be a good and fun way to practice English writing.

- Stardew Valley (星露谷)
- Kingdom Two Crows (王国：两位君主)
- Don't Starve Together (饥荒)
- Timberborn
- MineCraft (我的世界)
- Oxygen Not Included (缺氧)
- Horizon 4 (地平线)
