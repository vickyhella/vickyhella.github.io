# Games I've Played

The following are games that I've played recently. I think it's interesting to put them here to remind me all the fun they've given to me.

I will try to comment on all the games listed here (ToDo). I believe this might be a good and fun way to practice English writing.

- Stardew Valley
- Kingdom Two Crows
- Don't Starve Together
- Timberborn
- MineCraft
- Oxygen Not Included
- Horizon 4
