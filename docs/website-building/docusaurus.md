## Introduction

Docusaurus is a static website generator, which I used to build this website and help build our company's documentation websites. I learned I lot about the framework and want to record my learning process here.

### Why Docusaurus
When I first started building my own blog, I wrote it in HTML and CSS (yes, writing directly in HTML, kinda like what a newbee would do, LOL). But as I started to know Docusaurus, I realized it allows me to:
- Write directly in markdown, making it easy to maintain the content
- Use its preset themes
- Look more like a pro (indeed)

So I decided to migrate my blog to Docusaurus and I think it was a wise choice.

## Features to Implement
In order to allow myself to add content incrementaly, I will break down this document by feature and explain how each of them was implmented.
