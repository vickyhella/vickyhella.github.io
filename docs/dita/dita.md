## Why DITA?

DITA (short for Darwin Information Typing Architecture), is used for **creating and managing information that separates the content from the formatting**. I noticed that it's almost a must for technical writers to get the hang of DITA. Therefore I decided to take a short course on the Internet to learn about DITA.
