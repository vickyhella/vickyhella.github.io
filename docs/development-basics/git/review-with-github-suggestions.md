title: Reviewing with GH Suggestions
---

When giving comments on GitHub, rather than commenting directly, reviewers can use the **Add Suggestion** option to improve the efficiency.

## Reviewers

1. Find the line(s) you want to comment on and click the **+** button.
1. Click the **Add a Suggestion** button, and modify the content as needed. You can rewrite, delete, or add anything you need.
1. Click **Start a review**. If you only need to give one single suggestion, instead of clicking **Start a review**, you can click **Add a single comment** and finish your review.
1. Repeat steps 1-3 to add more comments.
1. When you finish the review, click **Finish your review** in the upper right corner.
1. (Optional) Write a comment to summarize your suggestions, and then click **Comment**.

## PR Owners

  1. Find the suggestions you want to accept and click **Add suggestion to batch** below each suggestion.
  1. When you finish adding the suggestions to batch, click **Apply suggestions**.
