Sometimes you might want to hide a specific page from the sidebar (the Markdown file is still stored in project repo, but doesn't render in production) but still access it via a URL.

If you use the Docusaurus framework as this website does, and generate sidebars using `autogenerated`, which doesn't allow you to manually remove specific pages from the sidebar, follow the steps below:

1. Add a new class to your CSS. By default, the CSS file should be `src/css/custom.css`:

  ```css
  .hidden {
  display: none !important;
  }
  ```

2. Add the following line to the metadata section of your Markdown files:

  ```yml
  sidebar_class_name: hidden
  ```

  To hide a whole category, add the line above to the `_category_.json` file.

After this, those pages won't appear in the sidebar.

To find more metadata for customization, see the ["Markdown front matter" section in the Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter).
