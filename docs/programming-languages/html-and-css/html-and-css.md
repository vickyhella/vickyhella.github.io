This section includes what I have newly learned about HTML and CSS.

## HTML elements

### `button`

`<button>` is an HTML element, and the `onclick` attribute and its value means every time this button is clicked, run the `myFunction` function.

**Syntax**:

```html
<button id="button-id" onclick="myFunction()">Button Text</button>
```
