This section includes what I have newly learned about HTML and CSS.

## HTML elements

### `button`

`<button>` is an HTML element, and the `onclick` attribute and its value means every time this button is clicked, run the `myFunction` function.

**Syntax**:

```html
<button id="button-id" onclick="myFunction()">Button Text</button>
```

## CSS styles

## HTML for Markdown

### Right-aligned text

By default, text is left-aligned in markdown. To make them right or center-aligned, use the line below in your markdown: 

```html
<div style="text-align: right"> your-text-here </div>
```

### Page break

To break a page in markdown, use the line below:

```html
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
```
