I expect the CAT to support the markdown format and preserve the original formats well (as much as possible).\\n\\n## Exploration of CATs\\n\\nI tried several CATs such as Trados, Wordfast (client), Matecat, and Smartcat, and found that OmegaT works the best for markdown files, especially when I need to do English-to-Chinese translation. Moreover, OmegaT is free and open-source, making it suitable for individual translators.\\n\\n## Advantages of OmegaT\\n\\n### 1. Format support:\\n\\nNatively, OmegaT does not support the markdown format. However, you can install an OKapi filter plugin to make OmegaT read markdown files.\\n\\nI tried to use the OKapi markdown filter in OmegaT and compared the formats of the source and target files. I found that the filter has the format preserved pretty well (especially compared with Trados, which changed the format a lot in indentation and line breaks).\\n\\n### 2. Other features:\\n\\nOther advantages of OmegaT are that it supports cooperation by allowing translators to push/pull projects to remote repositories, provides a lot of plugins, and uses lightweight glossary and TM formats.\\n\\n## Painpoints of OmegaT\\n\\nThe only format issue I found in OmegaT (with OKapi filter support) is that it removes or adds some spaces or line breaks somehow.\\n\\nHowever, I tried to preview the target markdown files using several markdown preview tools and found that the problem does not quite change the preview effect. So I believe it wouldnt be a big problem if translators can double-check the preview effect of the target file.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI have never used OmegaT before, so I still need to get used to the editor page and find out its other features.\\n\\nThough it does not work perfectly, yet, Im glad that I found and tried OmegaT and Im loving it."},{"id":"/2021/09/28/tools","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/09/28/tools","editUrl":"https://github.com/vickyhella/vickyhella.github.io/blog/2021-09-28-tools.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-28-tools.md","title":"Web-Based Translation Tools","description":"Overview","date":"2021-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 28, 2021","tags":[{"label":"grammarly","permalink":"/blog/tags/grammarly"},{"label":"languagetool","permalink":"/blog/tags/languagetool"},{"label":"highlight this","permalink":"/blog/tags/highlight-this"}],"readingTime":1.37,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Web-Based Translation Tools","tags":["grammarly","languagetool","highlight this"]},"prevItem":{"title":"CAT - OmegaT","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/17/omegat"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introduction","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/26/welcome"}},"content":"## Overview\\n\\nSometimes translators need to translate on web-based translation platforms (such as TransStudio Online). However, these platforms might not always offer satisfying services (such as real-time grammar/spell check) or do not support them at all. The following are several lite tools that I use a lot and highly recommend. They help improve the quality and accuracy of my deliverables.\\n\\n## Ready-to-Use Tools\\n\\n1. Grammarly (free of charge)\\n- Client: Chrome, Windows\\n- Feature: checks grammar and spelling after your translation is complete.\\n\\n2. LanguageTool (free of charge)\\n- Client: Chrome\\n- Feature: checks grammar and spelling in real time when youre typing in a text box.\\n\\n## Custom Tools\\n\\nSoon I realized these two tools are not enough, as they cannot detect the forbidden words (terms in the blocklist) in my translation. To tackle this problem, I found another tool and customize it. It works, though its not very convenient.\\n\\n3. Highlight This (free of charge)\\n- Client: Chrome\\n- Feature: highlights custom forbidden words.\\n- Instructions:\\n\\n    1.  Add the forbidden words to the Highlight This Chrome extension.\\n    2.  Copy your translation to Google Docs.\\n    3.  Find the highlighted forbidden words in Google Docs.\\n    4.  Revise the forbidden words in your translation.\\n\\nThis method is not very convenient, but I havent found a better way.\\n\\nYou can use this method if you need to ensure that no forbidden words show up in your deliverables.\\n\\n## To Be Continued\\n\\nI havent found a way to ensure the consistency of my translation when translating on a web-based platform. If I managed to figure out how to do that, I will add the method here later."},{"id":"/2021/08/26/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/26/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/vickyhella/vickyhella.github.io/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Introduction","description":"This section is to record my learning progress.
